# ARTCvan's Discord Server staff handbook
Welcome to the staff handbook of ARTCvan's Discord Server. This handbook will tell you instructions on moderation, when to use moderating commands and what you should do in cases when members do not listen.

## Introduction to the staff team
We have 2 people that have authority to remove staff permissions, ARTCvan (the owner) and xzvbnm, the Second in Charge, which takes over the owner if he isn't avaliable for certain days, or basically, the second owner. The owner basically has the authority to remove the Second in Charge, can remove/add staff, and owns the server. He makes the rules, is the one that decides if a bot should be added, etc.

The Second in Charge has almost the same authority as the owner, except they aren't allowed to change major things to the server. These two were the deciding factor over if you should have been hired (so be grateful lol). The owner and Second in Charge do decide almost everything, however for new hires, we do ask the admin team as well.

## How to handle tickets
The owner and Second in Charge sometimes handle tickets, however moderators / admins are expected to look handle the tickets primarily. Make sure not to delete tickets, nor talk about them once the person is done with the ticket. Staff are expected to close the ticket afterwards, but can be kept open **if** the owner/Second in Charge requests it to stay open.

Here is a table with what you should do in scenarios involving tickets.

| Scenario | What you should do |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Someone asks for personal help | Try to assist them if possible, otherwise direct them to helplines. |
| Someone reports a rule-breaker | Ask for reasoning/evidence, then follow steps below. |
| Someone reports a broken/offline bot | Determine if the bot is important, then post in announcements (if admin). |
| A feature of the server breaks | Post a message in the channel/announcements to say that feature is unavaliable. |
| Someone reports a training mod | Notify an executive or higher & ask for evidence. Also mute if needed. |
| Someone reports a mod/admin | Immediately ask them to switch into DMs |
| Someone opens a joke ticket | Warn them that they are not using the feature correctly and warn via Dyno. | 
| Other | Try to deal with it if possible, apply what's best in your opinion |

## How do you moderate?
This question shouldn't really be asked as, well, you probably know what you should do. Regardless, here's what you should do in emergency cases.

If a rule-breaker is spotted, warn them in either the channel they are talking in or #mod-commands if it's in a VC. 
If there is someone that is breaking Discord TOS, immediately mute them for an unspecified amount of time, as well as a reason.

To find a User's ID, enable Developer Options in the Discord client. Then right click their user (not their message/s) and Copy ID. The Copy ID user works better in cases like in #mod-commands, as it's basically copy-paste.

To warn, use Dyno's ?warn feature (as /warn doesn't work with Dyno right now), followed by the username#tag (or @[userid]) and then a reason. An example command would be: 

> ?warn @ARTCvan#1234 Broke rule 4.

To mute, use Dyno's ?mute feature (as again, there is no /mute with Dyno right now), followed by the username#tag (or @[theiruserid]), **OPTIONAL** an amount of time, then a reason. An example command would be: 

> ?mute @ARTCvan#1234 1h Repeatedly broke rules.
