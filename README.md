# ARTCvan's Discord Server staff handbook
Welcome to the staff handbook of ARTCvan's Discord Server. This handbook will tell you instructions on moderation, when to use moderating commands and what you should do in cases when members do not listen. Just as a side note, all staff roles can be revoked if you are breaking rules or similar. The warning system (found in staff-info) takes care of this (only for staff). Do not use any other Discord clients other then Discord's own client.

## Introduction to the staff team
We have 2 people that have authority to remove staff permissions, ARTCvan (the owner) and xzvbnm, the Second in Charge, which takes over the owner if he isn't avaliable for certain days, or basically, the second owner. The owner basically has the authority to remove the Second in Charge, can remove/add staff, and owns the server. He makes the rules, is the one that decides if a bot should be added, etc.

The Second in Charge has almost the same authority as the owner, except they aren't allowed to change major things to the server. These two were the deciding factor over if you should have been hired (so be grateful lol). The owner and Second in Charge do decide almost everything, however for new hires, we do ask the admin team as well.

Executives are basically promoted managers/admins that are highly trusted and help hire and make large decisions as well.

## How to handle tickets
The owner and Second in Charge sometimes handle tickets, however moderators / admins are expected to look handle the tickets primarily. Make sure not to delete tickets, nor talk about them once the person is done with the ticket. Staff are expected to close the ticket afterwards, but can be kept open **if** the owner/Second in Charge requests it to stay open.

Here is a table with what you should do in scenarios involving tickets.

<div align="center">

| Scenario | What you should do |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Someone asks for personal help | Try to assist them if possible, otherwise direct them to helplines. |
| Someone reports a rule-breaker | Ask for reasoning/evidence, then follow steps below. |
| Someone reports a broken/offline bot | Determine if the bot is important, then post in announcements (if admin). |
| Someone asks for a certain role | Go into #role-info and find the requirements, otherwise go to the table after this one. |
| Role scenario extention | If they are asking for a role that isn't requestable, then warn them in that chat/Dyno. |
| A feature of the server breaks | Post a message in the channel/announcements to say that feature is unavaliable. |
| Someone reports a training mod | Notify an executive or higher & ask for evidence. Also mute if needed. |
| Someone reports a mod/admin | Immediately ask them to switch into DMs |
| Someone opens a joke ticket | Warn them that they are not using the feature correctly and warn via Dyno. | 
| Other | Try to deal with it if possible, apply whatever's best in your opinion |

## How do you moderate?
This question shouldn't really be asked as, well, you probably know what you should do. Regardless, here's what you should do in emergency cases.

If a rule-breaker is spotted, warn them in either the channel they are talking in or #mod-commands if it's in a VC. 

If there is someone that is breaking Discord TOS, immediately mute them for an unspecified amount of time, as well as a reason and warn via Dyno.

If someone is posting NSFW, by all means, mute immediently and ban with a reason.

If someone is arguing with a staff member over a rule, warn the arguer with a reason.

If someone is posting GIF spam/spamming/voice spamming, mute and warn with reasons.

If someone is asking for a role in chat, then warn them with the reason.

If someone has found a loophole in something without telling staff, immediently mute them and patch the loophole ASAP.

## How do you ban/warn/mute someone or find a User ID?
To find a User's ID, enable Developer Options in the Discord client. Then right click their user (not their message/s) and Copy ID. The Copy ID user works better in cases like in #mod-commands, as it's basically copy-paste.

To warn, use Dyno's ?warn feature (as /warn doesn't work with Dyno right now), followed by the username#tag (or <@[userid]>) and then a reason. Example commands would be: 

> ?warn @ARTCvan#1234 Broke rule 4.
> 
> ?warn <@692612345677397920> Broke rule 3.

To mute, use Dyno's ?mute feature (as again, there is no /mute with Dyno right now), followed by the username#tag (or <@[theiruserid]>), **OPTIONAL** an amount of time, then a reason. Example commands would be: 

> ?mute @ARTCvan#1234 1h Repeatedly broke rules.
> 
> ?mute <@69212345687397920> 1h Did not listen to staff member twice.

To ban, use Dyno's ?ban feature (again, no  /ban for Dyno), followed by username#tag (or <@[theuserid]>), and then a reason. Example commands would be:

> ?ban @ARTCvan#1234 Sent NSFW content in the server.
> 
> ?ban <@6921234567287397920> Broke rules 3 times.

If for any reason, you need to lock a channel down, use ?lock, followed by #channel-name, **optional** an amount of time, then a reason. Example would be:

> ?lock #test-channel 1h Too much spam in this channel

And if you need to lock the entire server for certain reasons (raid or similar), use ?lockdown, **optional** an amount of time, then a reason. Example would be:

> ?lockdown Raid was incomming, please refain from entering VC. 

To end a lockdown, do ?lockdown end, **optional** a reason. Example would be

> ?lockdown end Everything is now fine.

Do note that these commands work everywhere on the server, and don't work on people above Moderator. You can not do this to a role either, and you should always give a reason to the action you done.
